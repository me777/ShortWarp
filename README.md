## Installation

## Features

### The Mod requires 2 things to set it up:
* A Signal in the control panel signals group called "WARP".
* A LCD (or Projector) also called "WARP" in view from your pilot seat.
#### You can make a short Warp by pointing your ship at a ship/base with the same faction as the pilot (only private works, faction will work soon) more than 2000 units away. You should get Output at the LCD. Now actiavate the signal and wait for the countdown (10s) to complete. The Warp will bring you to within 1050 units of the target. Now You have to disable the signal again to clear the LCD and reset the warp.
